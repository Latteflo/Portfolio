Personal Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio project done using React, SCSS, emailjs and other libraries. 
The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio that would showcase my work as a web developer. 

I used React because it is a powerful JavaScript library that makes creating user interfaces easier. 
I also used SCSS for the styling of my website because it is a more powerful CSS preprocessor than regular CSS. 
Lastly, I used emailjs to set up contact forms on my website so that potential employers could easily get in touch with me.
